# Agent Activation Triggers Update Summary

## Overview
Added explicit "When to Use This Agent" sections to all 11 agent configuration files to provide clear activation triggers and usage boundaries.

## Structure Added
Each agent now includes the following subsections after their description but before Core Responsibilities:

### 1. Explicit Trigger Conditions
- Specific user requests that should activate the agent
- Keywords and phrases that indicate agent relevance
- Task types that fall within agent's domain

### 2. Proactive Monitoring Conditions
- Automatic activation scenarios
- Code patterns or issues that trigger intervention
- System states requiring agent attention

### 3. Input Signals
- File types and patterns the agent monitors
- Configuration changes that matter
- External triggers (CI/CD, user feedback, etc.)

### 4. When NOT to Use This Agent
- Clear boundaries of agent responsibility
- Tasks better handled by other agents
- Specific exclusions to prevent overlap

## Agents Updated

1. **typescript-expert-agent.md**
   - Triggers: TypeScript/React implementation, type definitions, frontend state management
   - Monitors: .ts/.tsx files, type errors, component testing needs

2. **golang-expert-agent.md**
   - Triggers: Go backend implementation, API endpoints, microservices
   - Monitors: .go files, compilation errors, performance issues

3. **api-expert-agent.md**
   - Triggers: API design, REST/GraphQL/gRPC specs, versioning strategy
   - Monitors: OpenAPI/Swagger files, API inconsistencies, breaking changes

4. **project-manager-agent.md**
   - Triggers: Task creation, sprint planning, progress tracking
   - Monitors: Backlog.md changes, sprint deadlines, blocked tasks

5. **security-expert-agent.md**
   - Triggers: Security audits, authentication implementation, vulnerability scanning
   - Monitors: Auth endpoints, SQL queries, sensitive data handling

6. **devops-expert-agent.md**
   - Triggers: CI/CD setup, Docker/K8s config, deployment automation
   - Monitors: Build failures, infrastructure scaling, container vulnerabilities

7. **test-expert-agent.md**
   - Triggers: Test strategy, automation setup, coverage analysis
   - Monitors: Test failures, coverage drops, flaky tests

8. **tech-writer-agent.md**
   - Triggers: Documentation requests, README updates, API docs
   - Monitors: Outdated docs, missing documentation, style inconsistencies

9. **architect-expert-agent.md**
   - Triggers: System design, pattern selection, scalability planning
   - Monitors: Performance bottlenecks, technical debt, architectural drift

10. **agent-manager-agent.md**
    - Triggers: Agent system design, workflow optimization, coordination issues
    - Monitors: Agent conflicts, handoff failures, performance degradation

11. **project-optimizer-agent.md**
    - Triggers: Build optimization, project structure, bundle size reduction
    - Monitors: Build time thresholds, circular dependencies, workflow bottlenecks

## Benefits

1. **Clear Activation**: Each agent now has explicit conditions for when to activate
2. **Proactive Monitoring**: Agents can self-activate based on system state
3. **Reduced Overlap**: Clear boundaries prevent multiple agents from handling the same task
4. **Better Routing**: Users and the system can easily determine which agent to use
5. **Improved Efficiency**: Agents won't activate unnecessarily

## Next Steps

1. Update any agent invocation logic to respect these triggers
2. Consider creating a central dispatcher that uses these triggers
3. Monitor agent activation patterns to refine triggers over time
4. Add metrics to track trigger effectiveness

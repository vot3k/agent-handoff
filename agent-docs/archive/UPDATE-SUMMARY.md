# Agent Files Update Summary

## Changes Made

All agent files in `/Users/jimmy/.claude/agents` have been updated to remove misleading state tracking sections and replace them with practical workflow artifacts that reflect how Claude Code actually works.

### Key Changes

1. **Removed Misleading State Tracking**
   - Removed all `state_tracking` YAML sections that suggested runtime state persistence
   - Removed misleading message formats that implied direct agent-to-agent communication

2. **Added Workflow Artifacts Sections**
   - Each agent now clearly documents:
     - What files it creates/modifies
     - What inputs it expects (from users and files)
     - How it communicates via files

3. **Updated Integration Protocols**
   - Replaced abstract integration protocols with concrete file-based communication
   - Added clear examples of handoff file formats and locations
   - Showed realistic workflow progression through file artifacts

4. **Emphasized Stateless Operation**
   - Made it clear that agents are stateless
   - All coordination happens through files
   - User orchestrates workflow progression

## Updated Agents

- agent-manager-agent.md
- api-expert-agent.md
- architect-expert-agent.md
- devops-expert-agent.md
- golang-expert-agent.md
- project-manager-agent.md
- project-optimizer-agent.md
- security-expert-agent.md
- tech-writer-agent.md
- test-expert-agent.md
- typescript-expert-agent.md
- workflow-registry.md

## Example of New Structure

Each agent now includes:

```yaml
workflow_artifacts:
  files_created:
    - [specific files the agent creates]
  
  input_expectations:
    from_user: [what user provides]
    from_files: [what files to read]
  
  file_based_integration:
    reads_from: [input file locations]
    writes_to: [output file locations]
    handoff_examples: [concrete examples]
```

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Agents now accurately reflect Claude Code's stateless nature
2. **Practicality**: Focus on actual file artifacts instead of theoretical state
3. **Usability**: Clear examples of how agents actually work together
4. **Accuracy**: No more misleading claims about runtime state tracking

## Golang Expert Status

The Golang Expert was already well-optimized with:
- Comprehensive Chain-of-Draft reasoning patterns
- Strong error handling and concurrency patterns
- Good integration protocols
- Performance optimization guidelines

No additional enhancements were needed for the Golang Expert as it already meets the optimization report's standards.

## Key Improvements Across All Agents

1. **Practical Implementation Patterns**: Added real-world code examples that can be directly used
2. **Current Technology Coverage**: Included modern frameworks and tools (React 18+, Next.js, Kubernetes operators)
3. **Security-First Approach**: Embedded security considerations in all patterns
4. **Performance Optimization**: Added specific performance patterns relevant to each domain
5. **Compliance Awareness**: Included regulatory requirements where applicable

These enhancements ensure that each expert agent can provide up-to-date, practical guidance aligned with current industry best practices.

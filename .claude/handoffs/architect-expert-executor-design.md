  task_context: "Design comprehensive architecture for built-in agent executor system"
  priority: high

content:
  summary: "Design the overall architecture for the built-in agent executor approach, defining tool integration strategies, execution patterns, and extensibility frameworks"
  
  requirements:
    - "Design tool-agnostic execution strategies with priority-based selection"
    - "Define extensible architecture for new tool integrations"
    - "Create smart project context detection and environment awareness"
    - "Design fallback mechanisms for robustness"
    - "Plan for zero-configuration project setup experience"
    - "Ensure performance optimization and scalability"
    - "Define clear interfaces for built-in agent implementations"

  technical_details:
    current_limitations:
      - "Manual run-agent.sh copying required per project"
      - "Hard dependency on external script presence"
      - "No tool detection or intelligent selection"
      - "Limited extensibility for new tools"
      
    architectural_requirements:
      tool_integration:
        primary_tools: ["claude-code", "cursor", "vscode", "vim"]
        detection_strategy: "environment_scanning + binary_presence"
        priority_order: "claude-code > cursor > vscode > generic"
        
      execution_strategies:
        built_in_agents: "Native Go implementations for core agents"
        tool_bridge_agents: "Integration with external tools"
        generic_fallback: "Basic execution when no specific tools available"
        
      project_context:

        environment_setup: "Tool-specific working directory and env vars"

        agent_registry: "Dynamic registration of built-in agents"
        configuration_driven: "YAML/JSON based tool and agent config"

    success_metrics:
      user_experience: "Zero project setup - works immediately"
      compatibility: "100% backward compatibility maintained"
      tool_coverage: "Works with 90%+ of common development environments"
      performance: "Execution latency reduced by 50%+"
      maintenance: "No manual script management required"

  next_steps:
    - "Define tool detection and integration interfaces"
    - "Design execution strategy pattern architecture"
    - "Create project context detection framework"
    - "Design built-in agent implementation patterns"
    - "Define configuration and extensibility mechanisms"
    - "Plan performance optimization strategies"
    - "Coordinate with golang-expert for implementation"

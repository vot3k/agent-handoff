```

## Task Summary
Conduct comprehensive security analysis and define security requirements for a JWT authentication system. Your analysis will run in parallel with the architect-expert's system design to ensure security is built-in from the foundation.

## Security Analysis Scope
Please analyze and provide specifications for the following security domains:

### 1. JWT Security Specifications
- **Token Structure**: Secure JWT payload design and claims strategy
- **Signing Algorithms**: Recommended algorithms (RS256, ES256, etc.)
- **Key Management**: JWT signing key rotation and storage
- **Token Expiration**: Access token and refresh token lifecycle
- **Token Revocation**: Blacklisting and invalidation strategies

### 2. Authentication Security
- **Password Security**: Hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2, etc.)
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: TOTP/SMS integration patterns
- **Account Security**: Lockout policies and suspicious activity detection
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling and cleanup

### 3. API Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Authentication endpoint protection
- **CORS Configuration**: Cross-origin request security
- **Input Validation**: Request sanitization and validation
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without information leakage

### 4. Infrastructure Security
- **Transport Security**: TLS configuration requirements
- **Database Security**: Connection encryption and credential management
- **Environment Security**: Secret management and configuration
- **Monitoring Security**: Audit logging and security event tracking

## Threat Analysis Requirements
Please provide a comprehensive threat analysis covering:

### 1. Authentication Threats
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Protection strategies and detection
- **Credential Stuffing**: Prevention and mitigation approaches
- **Session Hijacking**: Token theft and replay attack prevention
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Communication security requirements

### 2. JWT-Specific Threats
- **Token Tampering**: Signature validation and integrity protection
- **Token Theft**: Secure storage and transmission requirements
- **Algorithm Confusion**: Signing algorithm validation
- **Key Confusion**: Public key validation and management

### 3. Application Threats
- **SQL Injection**: Database interaction security
- **XSS Protection**: Token storage in browser environments
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery prevention
- **Timing Attacks**: Constant-time comparison requirements

## Compliance Requirements
Ensure the security design meets:

### Industry Standards
- **OWASP Top 10**: Address all relevant security risks
- **JWT Best Practices**: RFC 7519 and security extensions
- **OAuth 2.0**: Bearer token security considerations
- **NIST Guidelines**: Authentication security recommendations

### Regulatory Considerations
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data protection and privacy requirements
- **CCPA Compliance**: California privacy regulations
- **SOC 2**: Security control requirements
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

## Expected Deliverables
Please provide the following security artifacts:

1. **JWT Security Specifications**
   - Token structure and claims definitions
   - Signing algorithm recommendations
   - Key management procedures
   - Token lifecycle management

2. **Threat Analysis Report**
   - Comprehensive threat model
   - Risk assessment matrix
   - Attack scenario analysis
   - Mitigation strategy recommendations

3. **Security Best Practices Guide**
   - Implementation security checklist
   - Code review security guidelines
   - Deployment security requirements
   - Operational security procedures

4. **Token Lifecycle Management**
   - Access token expiration policies
   - Refresh token rotation strategies
   - Token revocation mechanisms
   - Session cleanup procedures

## Integration Points
Your security specifications will integrate with:

### Architecture Design
- **System Architecture**: Security controls embedded in design
- **Component Security**: Service-level security requirements
- **Data Flow Security**: End-to-end security validation
- **Integration Security**: External service security requirements

### Implementation Guidance
- **Go Security Libraries**: Recommended security packages
- **Database Security**: ORM security configurations
- **Framework Security**: Gin/Echo security middleware
- **Testing Security**: Security test requirements

## Success Criteria
Your security analysis should provide:
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major authentication security risks addressed
- **Practical Implementation**: Clear, implementable security requirements
- **Compliance Alignment**: Meeting industry standards and regulations
- **Performance Balance**: Security measures that don't compromise performance
- **Operational Clarity**: Clear security procedures for deployment and maintenance

## Timeline and Coordination
**Target Completion**: 2 hours (parallel with architect-expert)
**Coordination Point**: Results will be merged with architectural design
**Next Phase**: Combined handoff to api-expert for secure API design

## Critical Security Requirements
Based on the user request, prioritize:

1. **JWT Implementation Security**: Industry-standard token security
2. **Go Backend Security**: Language-specific security best practices  
3. **Testing Security**: Security-focused test requirements
4. **Deployment Security**: Infrastructure security requirements

## Context for Integration
Your security specifications will be integrated into:
- **API Design**: Secure endpoint specifications
- **Implementation**: Security-first coding practices
- **Testing**: Security test scenarios and validation
- **Deployment**: Security-hardened infrastructure configuration

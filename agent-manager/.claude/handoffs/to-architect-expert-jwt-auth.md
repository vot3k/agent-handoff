workflow_id: "jwt-authentication-workflow"
stage: "Architecture & Security Design"
```

## Task Summary
Design a comprehensive JWT authentication system architecture for a Go backend service that supports secure user authentication, token management, and scalable deployment.

## Requirements Analysis
Based on the user request, the system must include:

### Core Requirements
- **Secure JWT Token Implementation**: Industry-standard JWT tokens with proper signing algorithms
- **Go Backend Service**: Modern Go implementation using current best practices
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and security testing
- **Deployment Infrastructure**: Production-ready deployment with CI/CD

### Technical Requirements
- **Scalability**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent users
- **Security**: OWASP compliance and JWT best practices
- **Maintainability**: Clean architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Observability**: Logging, monitoring, and health checks
- **Database Agnostic**: Flexible database integration layer

## Architecture Scope
Please design the following architectural components:

### 1. System Architecture
- **Overall system design** with clear component boundaries
- **Service layer architecture** following clean architecture principles
- **Database schema design** for user management and session tracking
- **API gateway integration** patterns for microservices readiness

### 2. Component Design
- **Authentication Service**: Core JWT token management
- **User Service**: User registration, login, and profile management
- **Middleware Layer**: JWT validation and request authentication
- **Security Layer**: Password hashing, rate limiting, and threat protection

### 3. Data Flow Design
- **Authentication Flow**: Login process with JWT token generation
- **Token Validation Flow**: Request authentication and authorization
- **Token Refresh Flow**: Secure token renewal mechanism
- **Logout Flow**: Token invalidation and cleanup

### 4. Integration Patterns
- **Database Integration**: ORM patterns and connection management
- **External Service Integration**: Email, SMS, or third-party auth providers
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis integration for session management
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger integration patterns

## Expected Deliverables
Please provide the following architectural artifacts:

1. **System Architecture Diagram**
   - High-level component overview
   - Service boundaries and responsibilities
   - Data flow visualization
   - Integration points

2. **Component Interaction Design**
   - Detailed service interactions
   - API communication patterns
   - Error handling flows
   - Security checkpoint locations

3. **Security Architecture Patterns**
   - JWT implementation patterns
   - Password security strategies
   - Rate limiting architecture
   - Threat mitigation patterns

4. **Database Schema Design**
   - User entity design
   - Session/token tracking tables
   - Audit logging schema
   - Index optimization strategy

## Technical Constraints
- **Go Language**: Must use Go 1.21 or higher
- **Framework Flexibility**: Support for Gin, Echo, or similar frameworks
- **Database Agnostic**: PostgreSQL primary, but flexible design
- **Container Ready**: Docker containerization support
- **Cloud Native**: Kubernetes deployment compatibility

## Success Criteria
Your architectural design should enable:
- **Security**: Robust protection against common authentication attacks
- **Performance**: Sub-100ms authentication response times
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capability
- **Maintainability**: Clear code organization and testing strategies
- **Compliance**: Industry security standards adherence

## Next Steps
After completing the architecture design, your work will be handed off to:
- **Security Expert**: For JWT security specifications and threat analysis
- **API Expert**: For detailed API contract design
- **Project Manager**: For implementation planning and sprint organization

The parallel work with the security expert will ensure that security considerations are integrated from the ground up, while the API expert will translate your architecture into concrete API specifications.

## Context for Handoff Recipients
The architecture you design will serve as the foundation for:
- Go backend implementation by golang-expert
- Comprehensive testing strategy by test-expert  
- Deployment infrastructure by devops-expert
- Technical documentation by tech-writer

Please ensure your design is detailed enough to guide implementation while remaining flexible enough to accommodate security recommendations and API design optimizations.

## Timeline
**Target Completion**: 2 hours
**Critical Path**: This work blocks API design and project planning stages
**Parallel Work**: Security expert will work simultaneously on threat analysis

Please begin the architecture design and provide your deliverables. Once complete, I will coordinate the handoff to the security-expert and api-expert for the next phase of the workflow.

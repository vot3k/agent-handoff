## Key Architectural Decisions

### Design Pattern Decision
```
PATTERN: Clean Architecture with Hexagonal Design
REASON: Testability and maintainability required
TRADEOFF: Initial complexity vs long-term flexibility
DECISION: Proceed with layered architecture
MONITOR: Component coupling metrics
```

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Go 1.21+ for performance and security
- **Framework**: Gin for HTTP routing (lightweight and fast)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and JSON support
- **Cache**: Redis for session management and rate limiting
- **JWT**: RS256 algorithm for asymmetric token signing
- **Observability**: Prometheus + Grafana + structured logging

### Security Architecture
- **Authentication**: JWT with 15-minute access tokens + 7-day refresh tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Password Security**: bcrypt with cost factor 12 + password policies
- **Rate Limiting**: Multi-level (global, per-user, per-IP)
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event tracking
- **Threat Protection**: Brute force protection and monitoring

## Service Architecture

### Service Boundaries
```yaml
authentication_service:
  responsibilities:
    - JWT token lifecycle management
    - Login/logout flow orchestration
    - Token validation and refresh
    - Security policy enforcement

user_service:
  responsibilities:
    - User registration and profiles
    - Password management
    - Account verification
    - Role assignment

token_service:
  responsibilities:
    - JWT token creation with claims
    - Token validation and parsing
    - Refresh token management
    - Blacklist/revocation handling

security_service:
  responsibilities:
    - Rate limiting enforcement
    - Threat detection and response
    - Audit event processing
    - Security metrics collection
```

### Database Schema Design
- **Users Table**: Comprehensive user data with roles and security fields
- **Refresh Tokens**: Secure token tracking with device information
- **JWT Blacklist**: Immediate token revocation support
- **Audit Logs**: Security event tracking for compliance
- **Roles & Permissions**: RBAC implementation tables

## Performance & Scalability

### Performance Targets
- **Login Response**: < 200ms p99
- **Token Validation**: < 50ms p99
- **Concurrent Users**: 10,000+
- **Throughput**: 1,000 login req/s

### Scalability Strategy
- **Stateless Services**: Enable horizontal scaling
- **Database Optimization**: Connection pooling, read replicas
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-tier caching with Redis
- **Load Balancing**: Round-robin with health checks

## Security Compliance

### OWASP Compliance
- Protection against all OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure session management
- Proper error handling without information disclosure

### JWT Best Practices
- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Secure refresh token storage
- Token blacklisting capability
- Asymmetric signing (RS256)

## Implementation Readiness

### Ready for golang-expert
The architecture is complete and ready for implementation. The handoff includes:

1. **Detailed Technical Specifications**
   - Clean architecture layer definitions
   - Service interfaces and contracts
   - Database schema with indexes
   - API endpoint specifications

2. **Security Requirements**
   - OWASP compliance guidelines
   - JWT implementation patterns
   - Password security policies
   - Rate limiting specifications

3. **Quality Requirements**
   - Test coverage targets (80%+)
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Code organization standards
   - Documentation requirements

4. **Deployment Specifications**
   - Docker containerization strategy
   - Kubernetes deployment patterns
   - Observability integration
   - Health check implementations

## Next Phase Coordination

### Parallel Workstreams
1. **golang-expert**: Core implementation (Primary)
2. **security-expert**: Security testing and validation
3. **api-expert**: API contract refinement
4. **devops-expert**: Deployment automation

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Architecture designed (COMPLETE)
- ⏳ Implementation initiated (golang-expert)
- ⏳ Security validation (security-expert)
- ⏳ API specification (api-expert)
- ⏳ Deployment automation (devops-expert)

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks Addressed
1. **JWT Security**: Asymmetric signing + short TTLs + blacklisting
2. **Password Security**: bcrypt + policies + breach protection
3. **Rate Limiting**: Multi-level protection + monitoring
4. **Audit Compliance**: Comprehensive logging + retention

### Monitoring Points
- Authentication success/failure rates
- Token validation performance
- Security event patterns
- System resource utilization

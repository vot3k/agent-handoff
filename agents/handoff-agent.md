# Handoff Agent

The Handoff Agent serves as the central coordinator for all inter-agent communication. It replaces the legacy file-based system with real-time Redis queue management, intelligent routing, and robust monitoring.

## IMPORTANT: System Integration Requirements
- Replaces file-based handoff communication with Redis queues.
- Provides real-time handoff processing and status tracking.
- Implements intelligent routing based on handoff content.
- Offers comprehensive monitoring and alerting capabilities.

## Chain-of-Draft (CoD) Reasoning

### Queue Management CoD
```
ANALYZE: Handoff requirements validation
ROUTE: Intelligent agent selection
QUEUE: Priority-based message ordering
PROCESS: Concurrent handoff execution
MONITOR: Real-time metrics collection
```

### Validation CoD
```
CHECK: Schema compliance verification
VERIFY: Agent-specific field validation
AUDIT: Artifact path normalization
REVIEW: Content sanitization
CONFIRM: Checksum integrity validation
```

## Core Responsibilities

- **Queue Management**: Manages Redis-based message queues with priority handling and dead-letter logic.
- **Intelligent Routing**: Selects the correct agent based on handoff content and configurable rules.
- **Schema Validation**: Enforces the Unified Handoff Schema and validates agent-specific fields.
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Tracks real-time system metrics and triggers alerts on performance issues.

## System Architecture

The handoff system consists of several core components that work together:

- **Handoff Agent**: The main coordination service that manages Redis queues and orchestrates handoffs.
- **Handoff Router**: An intelligent routing system that directs handoffs to the correct agent based on content analysis.
- **Handoff Validator**: A service that validates handoff payloads against the unified schema.
- **Handoff Monitor**: A component that collects metrics and manages alerts for system health.

## Handoff Schema

Handoffs are structured as YAML payloads sent via Redis.

```yaml
# The unified schema for all inter-agent handoffs.
metadata:
  project_name: string      # The project context for the handoff.
  from_agent: string        # The name of the agent sending the handoff.
  to_agent: string          # The name of the agent receiving the handoff.
  timestamp: datetime       # ISO 8601 timestamp of handoff creation.
  task_context: string      # A brief description of the overall task.
  priority: enum            # low|normal|high|critical
  handoff_id: string        # A unique identifier for the handoff.

content:
  summary: string           # A one-line summary of the work done or requested.
  requirements: string[]    # A list of specific requirements for the receiving agent.
  artifacts:
    created: string[]       # List of file paths created by the `from_agent`.
    modified: string[]      # List of file paths modified by the `from_agent`.
    reviewed: string[]      # List of file paths reviewed by the `from_agent`.
  technical_details: object # A flexible object for agent-specific data and instructions.
  next_steps: string[]      # A list of recommended next actions for the `to_agent`.

validation:
  schema_version: string    # The version of the handoff schema (e.g., "1.1").
  checksum: string          # An optional checksum to verify content integrity.
```

## Communication Protocol

- **Publishing**: An agent creates a handoff payload and publishes it to a project-specific Redis queue.
  - **Queue Name Format**: `handoff:project:{project_name}:queue:{agent_name}`
- **Consuming**: The `agent-manager` listens on these queues. When a message is received, it dispatches the task to the correct agent, setting the `AGENT_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable.

## Example Scenarios

**Scenario**: API Design to Go Implementation
- **Trigger**: `api-expert` completes an OpenAPI specification.
- **Process**: `api-expert` publishes a handoff to the `handoff:project:my-app:queue:golang-expert` queue. The payload contains the OpenAPI spec in the `technical_details`.
- **Output**: `agent-manager` receives the message and executes `golang-expert` to begin implementation.

**Scenario**: High Queue Depth Alert
- **Trigger**: The queue depth for `handoff:project:my-app:queue:test-expert` exceeds 50 items.
- **Process**: The `HandoffMonitor` detects the threshold breach and triggers a "high-queue-depth" alert.
- **Output**: A notification is sent to the monitoring system or a designated operator.

**Scenario**: Failed Handoff Retry
- **Trigger**: An implementation handoff fails due to a temporary error (e.g., a network issue).
- **Process**: The system classifies the error as retryable, applies an exponential backoff policy, and re-queues the handoff message.
- **Output**: The handoff is successfully processed after a short delay.
